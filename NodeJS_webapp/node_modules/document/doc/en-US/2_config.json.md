# Configurations

## Basic Configurations






### Specify the 'doc' Directory

By default, if your repo is based on commonjs, document will use the [`directories.doc`](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Packages/1.0#Package_Directory_Layout) field of the package.json as the document root.

If there's no package.json or no `directories.doc` field, document will use 'doc' folder by default.

But you can specify it by using `--doc` argument, for example:

```sh
document --doc /somewhere/else
```

### Basic Informations

It's best to use `document` command at the root of your repo, in order to read the package.json.

Document will try to read the 'config.json' file inside the 'doc' folder, which has higher priority upon 'package.json'.
